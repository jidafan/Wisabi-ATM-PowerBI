## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze the ATM transaction data for Wisabi Bank to gain insights into customer behaviour and ATM usage. To achieve this, I will be using PowerBI to create a dashboard that showcases relevant KPIs and trends that will help the executives at Wisabi Bank make informed business decisions regarding the ATMs.

## Data Review

This project will focus on analyzing ATM transactions for Wisabi Bank from the dates of January 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2022, spanning the entire year of 2022. The data will show data from various states in which Wisabi Bank operates, the data will be from Lagos, Kano, Enugu, Rivers, and FCT Abuja. 

## PowerBI Dashboard

The multi-layered PowerBi dashboard allows one to look at the trends, utilization rates of ATMs, and relevant KPIs on one page. Another page allows one to see the demographic data surrounding the ATMs, about age groups, and use by occupation. To navigate through these pages users can ctrl + click on the buttons on the left side of the dashboard allowing traversal through pages and the use of filters.
